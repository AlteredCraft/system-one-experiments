# Working in this repo

- Each top-level directory is an independent experiment. Work inside one at a time; don't share code
  between them.
- Every experiment's README has **Hypothesis**, **Checks** and **Open**. Take the first Open item.
  When a check gets evidence, record it in that README with the date and the commit or PR.
- Tests first. Unit tests use the scripted decider and never call the network or need
  `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. Live runs belong in `eval/` scripts and write their results to files.
- Keep thresholds and arithmetic in code, never in question text. Pin the model version for any
  run whose numbers you record.
- Loosening a check, or changing what an experiment is trying to show, needs the user.
